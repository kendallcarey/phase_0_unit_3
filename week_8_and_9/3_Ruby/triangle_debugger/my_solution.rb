# U3.W8-9: Triangle Debugger


# I worked on this challenge:
# 1) Amol Borcar
# 2) Kendall Carey


# 1. Original Solution

def valid_triangle?(a, b, c)
  sum = 0
  if a != 0 || b != 0 || c != 0
    if a >= b
      largest = a
      sum += b
    else 
      largest = b
      sum += a
    end
    if c > largest
      sum += largest
      largest = c
    else 
      sum += c
    end
    if sum > largest
      return true
    else 
      return false
    end
  else 
    return false
  end
end


# 2. Answer the question for each bug

# --- Bug 1 ---
# * what is the exact description of the error? 
# it was expecting 4 arguments instead of 3
# * what is the exact line number the error is appearing? 
# line 9
# * before you fix the bug, what do you think is causing the error? 
# The wrong amount of arguments, should be 3.

# --- Bug 2 ---
# * what is the exact description of the error?
# no method for '+'
# * what is the exact line number the error is appearing?
# lines 14, 17, 21, 24
# * before you fix the bug, what do you think is causing the error?
# we deleted sum from the arguments and so the sum method didn't make sense

# --- Bug 3 ---
# * what is the exact description of the error?
# expected true value, got false value, and vice-versa
# * what is the exact line number the error is appearing?
# lines 20 and 46
# * before you fix the bug, what do you think is causing the error?
# the code is not returning true and false as boolean values, it is returning "true" and "false" as strings


# 3. Refactored Solution (Comment the other code to run this)

def valid_triangle?(a, b, c)
  if a != 0 || b != 0 || c != 0
  a+b>c && a+c>b && b+c>a
  end
end

# 1. DRIVER TESTS/ASSERT STATEMENTS GO BELOW THIS LINE

p valid_triangle?(3,4,5) == true
p valid_triangle?(5,5,600) == false
p valid_triangle?(10,10,11) == true
p valid_triangle?(1,1,100) == false

# 5. Reflection 
# This was a lot of fun with Amol! He figured everything out super quickly 
# and allowed me extra time to see it too without ruining it. We definitely 
# grumbled about refactoring it but we figured that out in seconds! 
# Pretty cool.
