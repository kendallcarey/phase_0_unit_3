# U3.W8-9: Reverse Words


# I worked on this challenge Amol Borcar and Kendall Carey.

# 2. Pseudocode
# Create a method that accepts a string as an argument
	# Create an array with each word in the string as an element in the array
	# Iterate through each element in the array
	# Reverse each element in the array
	# Join back into a combined string
	# Return combined string


# 3. Initial Solution
def reverse_words(string)
	string.split(" ").map{|x| x.reverse}.join(" ").to_s
end




# 4. Refactored Solution






# 1. DRIVER TESTS/ASSERT STATEMENTS GO BELOW THIS LINE
