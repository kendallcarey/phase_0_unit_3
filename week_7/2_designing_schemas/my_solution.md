# U3.W7: Designing Schemas


#### I worked on this challenge [by myself, with: ]


## Release 0: Student Roster Schema
<!-- display your image inline here -->


## Release 1: One to Many Schema
<!-- display your image inline here -->


## Release 2: One to One Schema
<!-- display your image inline here -->


## Release 3: Many to Many Schema
<!-- display your image inline here -->


## Release 4: Design your own Schema
Description of what you're modeling: 

<!-- display your one-to-one image inline here -->
<!-- display your many-to-many image inline here -->

## Release 5: Reflection
# I thought this was going to be a lot more difficult than it was
# It can be a bit tedious though I think what took me the most time was
# trying to think of another one-to-one schema. Pretty cool. I don't really
# have much else to say about it.
