####I worked on this challenge by myself.



### My Quiz Results:
# Having troubles with my git and github again. Promise it will be fixed by tomorrow! But until then:

### Reflection

# I don't think I'm the first one to have a like/hate relationship with SQLZOO
# Yes it can be useful but it is frustrating and buggy. I learned a lot about
# syntax but it was a long frustrating challenge making sure I understood what
# I got wrong and why it was wrong.
